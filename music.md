# Music

If one would say that music has three big categories, namely Jazz, Classic and Pop, then my music would fall clearly into the category Pop.
Furthermore, i make and listen to pop which incorporates elements of electronica, industrial rock and "singer songwriter".
Some artists i value highly are Aphex Twin, Radiohead, Sufjan Stevens and Burial.
On this page i present (in reverse quasi-chronological order) my music career, accomponied by small stories explaining the context of those moments.

For my full discography, go to this [link](./discography).  
[Here](./live) you can find a (probably incomplete) list of everywhere i've played live.

## Laurens Collee

From a young age i had music lessons. Around my 13th year I was also interested in electronic music, recording and live audio. 
Gerjan van der Giessen taught me from a young age about live audio and eventually gave me the trust to be the sound engineer for [UitDeLoods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxmOK_ZM7hI) livestreams. Laurens was a friend from Gerjan and my parents, and we had also played together often in the church band. 
We started recording his EP in the same room as we made the UitDeLoods stream. And this would become the first EP i have produced.

# Projects

This is a collection of some bigger projects i worked on in math, music and more.

<hr/>

[## Lumus Instruments](https://www.lumus-instruments.com/)

Lumus Instruments develop interactive dynamic lightning systems for clubs or art exhibitions.
I developed an algorithm and device which translates audio to control signals used in the lightning systems. 
I also developed a control panel for the system.

[## Bitfox Eurorack](https://github.com/bitfox-git/eurorack)

These are my schematics, designs and code for eurorack modules and other side projects. 
Eurorack is a format in which one can do modular audio synthesis, modular meaning that the topology of the synthesizer is not fixed.
This is mostly an archive which contains eagle files for the pcb design and schematic, and c/cpp code for the digital modules.
Here is a [link](https://bitfox-git.github.io/usbmidi-config/) to a web application to configure a digital usb-midi module, and a [link](https://github.com/Chrisvossetje/chrisEurorack) to two other designs.

[## Westerpark Walk](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/westerparkwalk/id1624972841)

The Westerpark Walk is an interactive sound tour using music from Corrie van Binsbergen, Dilruba Tayfun and Wilde woorden.
The app uses gps to play audio at specified locations. 
The app has been developed for the municipality of amsterdam, and more specifically the westerpark.

# Teaching

Next to creating music i also teach music.
In my teaching i look at what the individual needs.
We work on the subjects which fit your goals and don't get distracted by the norm.

I can and have taught in the following subjects:

Bass Guitar, Composition, Electronics (Live and Studio), Music Production, Mixing

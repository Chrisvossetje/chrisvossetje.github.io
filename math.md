# Math

I'm a Master student at the Utrecht University. My main interest lie, in general, in homotopy theory.
More specifically am i interested in unstable synthetic homotopy theory.
I'm also interested in calculations and computations in homotopy theory, especially with regards to (unstable) homotopy groups of spheres.

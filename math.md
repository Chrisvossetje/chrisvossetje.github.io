# Math

I'm a Master student at the Utrecht University. My main interest lie, in general, in homotopy theory.
More specifically am i interested in unstable synthetic homotopy theory.
I'm also interested in calculations and computations in homotopy theory, especially with regards to (unstable) homotopy groups of spheres.

Some projects i have worked on:

- A [website](https://www.chrisvos.net/comodules-web/) and [algorithm](https://github.com/Chrisvossetje/comodules/) to calculate Ext over a k-coalgebra. This goal of the algorithm is to aid computations in algebraic topology. This project was done with Jacco Hijmans as a part of our bachelor thesis under supervision of Dr. G.S.K.S. Heuts at Utrecht University.

- A computer program which counts smooth homogeneous polynomials of degree n in $\mathbb{P}^2$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$. The program is split into two parts. [First](https://github.com/Jake-O-Dev/isopoly_generation) we act with $\mathbb{P}GL_3(\mathbb{F}_p)$ on all degree n homogeneous polynomials to find the isomorphism classes. In the [second](https://github.com/Chrisvossetje/smooth_polynomial_counter) part we check whether the polynomial is non singular for any (finite) field extension of $\mathbb{F}_p$. Because the degree of our polynomials is fixed, the order of the field extensions are also bounded. This project was done with Jacco Hijmans as a summer project in 2023 under supervision of Prof. Dr. C.F. Faber at Utrecht University.
